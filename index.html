			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>We have decided to create a tool to facilitate the growth of students in the real world, allowing them to gain levels of experience, practice and develop a clear understanding of risk-taking and seeking their own dreams, while enveloping their full potential.</p>

			<p>“FundUp” could allow students like us to either develop their ideas and creativity via finding possible investors in their start-ups or facilitating climbing the ladder to become future investors. We believe that the truth lies in providing resources and it remains up to the people how those resources will be used.</p>
